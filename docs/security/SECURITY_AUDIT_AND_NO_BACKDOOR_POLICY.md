# Security Audit and No Backdoor Policy

**Repository**: RedRoomRewards  
**Last Updated**: 2026-01-04  
**Status**: Authoritative  
**Review Schedule**: Quarterly

---

## Executive Summary

This document establishes the security principles, audit requirements, and no-backdoor policies for the RedRoomRewards platform. All code, configurations, and operational practices must comply with these security standards without exception.

**Core Principle**: Assume all third-party and legacy code is untrusted until proven secure through audit and review.

---

## 1. Security Principles

### 1.1 Zero Trust Model

**Principle**: Never trust, always verify.

**Requirements**:
- ✅ Authenticate every request
- ✅ Authorize every operation
- ✅ Validate all inputs server-side
- ✅ Verify all signatures and tokens
- ✅ Audit all financial operations
- ❌ No implicit trust relationships
- ❌ No bypass mechanisms "for convenience"
- ❌ No disabled security checks

**Enforcement**:
- All API endpoints require authentication (except `/health`)
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all operations
- Request signing for sensitive operations
- Continuous security monitoring and alerting

### 1.2 Defense in Depth

**Principle**: Multiple layers of security controls.

**Security Layers**:
1. **Network**: TLS 1.3, firewall rules, IP whitelisting
2. **Application**: Input validation, output encoding, rate limiting
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens, session management, MFA for admin
4. **Authorization**: RBAC, least privilege, operation-specific permissions
5. **Data**: Encryption at rest, encryption in transit, field-level encryption for PII
6. **Audit**: Immutable logs, tamper detection, 7+ year retention
7. **Monitoring**: Real-time alerts, anomaly detection, security dashboards

**Rationale**: If one layer fails, others provide protection.

### 1.3 Secure by Default

**Principle**: Security is the default state, not an option.

**Default Security Posture**:
- Authentication required by default
- Minimum privileges by default
- Encryption enabled by default
- Logging enabled by default
- Rate limiting enabled by default
- Secrets never in code by default

**Overrides**: Any security control override requires:
- Explicit documentation
- Security review and approval
- Time-limited exception (with expiry)
- Compensating controls

---

## 2. Third-Party and Legacy Code Policy

### 2.1 Untrusted Until Proven Secure

**Policy**: All third-party dependencies and legacy code are considered untrusted.

**Third-Party Dependencies**:

- ✅ License compliance verification
- ✅ Regular updates and patching
- ✅ Vendor security track record review
- ❌ No dependencies with known critical CVEs
- ❌ No unmaintained or abandoned packages
- ❌ No dependencies from untrusted sources

**Audit Requirements**:
1. Review package source code for backdoors
2. Verify package signatures and checksums
3. Check for known vulnerabilities in CVE databases
4. Assess maintainer reputation and history
5. Review open issues and security advisories
6. Test package behavior in isolated environment

### 2.2 Legacy Code Prohibition

**ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION**: No code from `/archive/xxxchatnow-seed/` may be used.

**Rationale**:

**Permitted Actions**:
- ✅ Viewing for historical context only
- ✅ Learning what NOT to do
- ✅ Understanding past mistakes

**Enforcement**:
- Code reviews will reject any legacy patterns
- Automated scanning for legacy code signatures
- PR rejection for any archive references

### 2.3 Code Review Requirements

**Mandatory Reviews**:
- All new dependencies before adoption
- All security-sensitive code changes
- All authentication/authorization modifications
- All cryptographic implementations
- All financial logic changes

**Review Checklist**:
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] No backdoors or debug endpoints
- [ ] No security control bypasses
- [ ] No logging of sensitive data
- [ ] No use of insecure functions (e.g., eval, innerHTML)
