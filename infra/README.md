# Infrastructure Directory

This directory contains infrastructure configuration and database management.

## Structure

- **migrations/** - Database migration scripts (scaffolded)
- **db/** - Database connection and configuration (scaffolded)
- **config/** - Application configuration files (scaffolded)

## Status

All subdirectories are currently **scaffolded only**. Implementation will be
added in subsequent phases.

## Purpose

Infrastructure code manages:

- Database schema migrations
- Database connection pooling and configuration
- Environment-specific configuration
- Secrets management (in production)

## Development Guidelines

When implementing infrastructure:

- Use environment variables for configuration
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Version all database migrations
- Include rollback scripts for migrations
- Test migrations on staging before production

See `/SECURITY.md` for security requirements.
