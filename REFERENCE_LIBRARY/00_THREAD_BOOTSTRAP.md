## HOW TO USE THIS DOCUMENT

Read this at the **START** of every new Claude Chat thread working on BUILD
CONTROL - REWARDS. Read the handoff document **AFTER** this. Then proceed.

This document replaces any multi-URL orientation ritual. The handoff carries
only: current state, open PRs, next action. Everything structural lives here and
in the sibling library files.
