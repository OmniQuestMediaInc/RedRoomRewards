## What shipped

Moved the root `CLAUDE.md` governance file to `archive/governance/CLAUDE_2026-04-21.md` as a pure `git mv` (100% rename, no content change). Added `archive/README.md` declaring the archive read-only invariant and naming RRR-GOV-002 as the single current policy source. Pointed `.github/copilot-instructions.md` at the active charter via a new `Active Charter:` entry at the top of the Source-of-Truth block. Removed the `archive/` rule from `.gitignore` as a root-cause fix — the charter's §0 persistence model keeps retired charters permanently under `archive/governance/`, which is incompatible with the path being git-ignored; without the edit, the acceptance criterion `git ls-files archive/governance/CLAUDE_2026-04-21.md` could not have been satisfied. Flagged the `.gitignore` change explicitly in the report-back's Operator Decisions section and in the PR body for CEO visibility; CEO merged the PR as-is.

## Acceptance verified

- [x] `grep -r "CLAUDE.md" .github/` → no results
- [x] `grep -r "RRR-GOV-002" .github/copilot-instructions.md` → at least one match (line 14)
