**Path (repo):** `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/CNZ-CLAUDE-CODE-KICKOFF.md`
**Version:** 1.0.0
**Issued:** 2026-04-22
**Session type:** FIRST LIVE SESSION — Wave A completion + Waves B/C parallel start

-----

## STEP 1 — READ BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE

Read these files in order before taking any action:

1. `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/CNZ-CLAUDE-CODE-STANDING-PROMPT.md` — your standing execution authority
1. `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md` — supreme rulebook
1. `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` — current state tracker
1. `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/CNZ-WORK-001.md` — active task charter (65 tasks, Waves A–H)

Do not execute any task until all four files are read.

-----

## STEP 2 — GROUND TRUTH: WHAT IS ALREADY DONE

The following Wave A tasks are confirmed DONE as of 2026-04-22. Do NOT re-execute them. Verify their status in `CNZ-WORK-001.md` matches DONE before proceeding.

## STEP 3 — GROUND TRUTH: WHAT IS PENDING / ELIGIBLE NOW

The following Wave A tasks remain. Execute all that are unblocked. Surface CEO_GATE items without merging.

|Task|Description                                                                                       |CEO_GATE|Notes                                                              |
|----|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|A006|Delete root `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` (v2.0 retired file)                                            |NO      |Verify `required-files.txt` no longer references it before deleting|
|A011|Create `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/DONE/` and `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/` directories if absent|NO      |May already exist — verify first; create only if missing           |
|A012|Define and commit the canonical commit-prefix enum                                                |YES     |CEO merges                                                         |
|A013|Author and commit `docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md` initial scaffold                                      |NO      |Verify if already present before creating                          |
|A099|Wave A close-out: verify all Wave A tasks DONE, update SYSTEM_STATE, file Wave A DONE-record      |NO      |Execute last, after all other Wave A tasks complete                |

**Verify before executing A006:** confirm `OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` at repo root is NOT the same file as `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md`. Root version is retired; QUEUE/ version is active SoT. Delete root version only.

-----

## STEP 4 — WAVE B AND C: AUTHORIZE PARALLEL START

After Wave A tasks above are underway, begin Waves B and C in parallel.

### Wave B — CEO-Decision Surfacing

**B001** — Consolidate the 12 R-CLARIFY rows into a single CEO pass document.

Produce a markdown file at `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/R-CLARIFY-CONSOLIDATED.md` containing:

- All 12 R-CLARIFY items listed verbatim from the charter
- For each: the decision question, the downstream tasks blocked pending the answer, and a blank `CEO ANSWER:` field
- No answers. No recommendations. Surface only.
- PR: auto-merge eligible (CEO_GATE: NO — this is a surfacing document, not a governance doc)
- Mark B001 DONE once PR is open

The 12 items are:

1. R-CLARIFY-001: CreatorControl.Zone scope vs My Zone Manager
1. R-CLARIFY-002: MyCrew.Zone — custom or Twenty CRM integration
1. R-CLARIFY-003: Room-Heat Engine — standalone service or platform feature
1. R-CLARIFY-004: FairPay/FairPlay — inside Wallet or separate service
1. R-CLARIFY-005: DFSP™ — define acronym and clarify scope
1. R-CLARIFY-006: Human Contact Zone vs HeartZone — confirm separate, clarify HZ commit prefix
1. R-CLARIFY-007: Cyrano™ — which of 4 architectural layers is in launch scope
1. R-CLARIFY-008: Welfare Guardian Score — subsume into Risk Engine or standalone (note: Grok prototype evidence suggests WGS as parent layer)
1. R-CLARIFY-009: RedRoomRewards™ — separate repo or inside this repo
1. R-CLARIFY-010: HeartZone IoT Loop ↔ HeartPleasureExperiences™ relationship
1. R-CLARIFY-011: Bijou.Zone Theatre — which Park(s)
1. R-CLARIFY-012: Frontend repo / app location (no `apps/` in repo; only `ui/types/`)

### Wave C — Plan Amendments

The following Wave C tasks are CEO_GATE. Prepare each as a PR with a clear amendment proposal. Do NOT merge.

|Task|Amendment                                                                                                                                        |Notes        |
|----|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|
|C002|R-P0-001: CZT vs SZT token architecture — NOTE: SZT is RETIRED. CZT (ChatZoneTokens™) is the sole currency. Amend plan to reflect CZT throughout.|CEO_GATE: YES|
|C003|R-P0-002: SilverBullet tier mismatch — surface discrepancy for CEO resolution                                                                    |CEO_GATE: YES|
|C004|R-P0-004: GateGuard volume model recalculation — flag for CFO/CPA-equivalent sign-off                                                            |CEO_GATE: YES|
|C005|R-P0-005: JuryPulse — define or pull from scope                                                                                                  |CEO_GATE: YES|
|C007|R-P0-007: Per-claim sign-off on cited/qualified technical assertions                                                                             |CEO_GATE: YES|

For each C-task: author a brief amendment memo (markdown, `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/`) that states the discrepancy, the proposed amendment, and leaves a `CEO DECISION:` field blank. Open as CEO_GATE PR. Record in REPORT_BACK.

-----

## STEP 5 — BRANCH PROTECTION NOTE

Branch protection is now active on `main`. Auto-merge is enabled at the repo level. PRs marked `CEO_GATE: NO` that pass CI will auto-merge. PRs marked `CEO_GATE: YES` will not — they await CEO manual merge. This is the intended behavior.

-----

## STEP 6 — KNOWN ISSUES TO VERIFY

Before closing this session, verify and report on:

1. **`npm run validate:schema` vs Yarn invariant** — The amendment PR reported `npm run validate:schema: OK`. Confirm this is a script alias only (not `npm install`). Flag if it invokes package installation. See OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md §5.3.
1. **A005 / A017 sequencing** — A005 (archive Sovereign Kernel) merged in PR #248 before A017 (required-files.txt fix) landed via the amendment PR. Confirm no CI artifact from this sequencing remains. Check PR #248’s CI log if accessible.
1. **`OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` populated version** — Confirm the populated SYSTEM_STATE (authored in Thread 19 and dropped into QUEUE/) is the version currently at `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` — not the placeholder template.
1. **`claude/init-chatnowzone-build-3AVaE` branch** — This branch was deleted from remote during Thread 19. Confirm it is gone and no dangling references exist.
1. **Commit count baseline** — Thread 19 opened at 436 commits. Note current count in REPORT_BACK.

-----

## STEP 7 — SESSION CLOSE REQUIREMENTS

Before ending this session:

1. File `PROGRAM_CONTROL/REPORT_BACK/` REPORT_BACK per standing prompt protocol
1. Update `PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md` with session outcomes
1. Create DONE-records for any tasks completed this session
1. List all open CEO_GATE PRs in REPORT_BACK with PR numbers
1. State recommended starting point for next session

-----

## WHAT NOT TO TOUCH

- `RRR-GOV-002` — out of scope, do not read or act on
- `OQMI_PROTOTYPE_STANDARDS.md` — External Prototyping Track; do not author or modify
- GateGuard Sentinel prototype materials — External Prototyping Track
- Wave D, E, F, G, H work — not yet authorized; Wave A must close first

-----

## TOKEN CURRENCY NOTE

**CZT (ChatZoneTokens™) is the sole platform currency.** SZT is retired. Any reference to SZT in existing plan documents is stale. When Wave C task C002 executes, amend accordingly. Do not model or reference SZT in any new content.

-----

**This kickoff prompt is a one-time session ignition document. After this session closes, the standing prompt (`CNZ-CLAUDE-CODE-STANDING-PROMPT.md`) governs all future sessions without requiring a new kickoff.**

**End of CNZ-CLAUDE-CODE-KICKOFF.md v1.0.0**
