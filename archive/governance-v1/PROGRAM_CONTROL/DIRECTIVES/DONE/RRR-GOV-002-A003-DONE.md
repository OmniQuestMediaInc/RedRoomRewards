# RRR-GOV-002-A003 — DONE

**Charter:** RRR-GOV-002 (persistent, see PROGRAM_CONTROL/DIRECTIVES/QUEUE/RRR-GOV-002.md)

**Task ID:** RRR-GOV-002-A003

**Title:** Create GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md

**Merged:** 2026-04-21

**Merge commit:** e71ef5bec742674628c003d70d9f31e9fc29f8f7

**PR:** #234

**Agent executed:** claude-code

**Agent hint matched:** no (charter hint was `copilot`; override authorized in-session by operator after Copilot failed to engage the task — per charter §2.3, agent hint is a routing suggestion, not an exclusivity lock)

**CEO_GATE:** NO — n/a

**FIZ:** NO

## What shipped

Created `PROGRAM_CONTROL/GOV-GATE-TRACKER.md` as the single-pane status board for every `CEO_GATE: YES` directive under RRR-GOV-002. The file documents its purpose, maintenance rules (add row on PR open, flip on merge/close, never delete rows), explicit scope limit (charter-era only, no pre-charter backfill), and a `Status vocabulary` table (`OPEN` / `MERGED` / `CLOSED_UNMERGED`). The Directives table uses the exact schema specified in task scope: `Directive ID | Status | PR # | Opened | Merged | Notes`. Pre-populated with the two required seed rows: RRR-GOV-002 (charter ratification, merge commit `ccb288e`, persistent per §0) and RRR-GOV-002-A001 (archive CLAUDE.md, PR #227, merge commit `954dec9`).

## Acceptance verified

- [x] File exists, parseable as Markdown table
- [x] Both seed rows present (RRR-GOV-002 and RRR-GOV-002-A001)

## Follow-ups filed

- **Pending charter amendment (tracked, not actioned).** Operator indicated the CEO is amending RRR-GOV-002 to retire the `CEO_GATE` concept entirely. As of A-003 merge, that amendment has not landed on `main`. If/when it does, the GOV-GATE-TRACKER gracefully becomes an archival record of charter-era CEO-gated merges rather than a live board. No code action required from A-003.
