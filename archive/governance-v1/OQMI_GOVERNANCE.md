OQMI GOVERNANCE
Document: OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md Authority: OmniQuest Media Inc. (OQMInc™) Scope: Generic, repo-portable. Drops into every OmniQuest Media Inc. repository unchanged. Version: v1.0 Effective Date: 2026-04-21 Authority of Record: Kevin B. Hartley, CEO — OmniQuest Media Inc. Platform Time Standard: America/Toronto

0. PURPOSE

This document is the standing governance instrument for every OmniQuest Media Inc. repository. It defines:

The CEO assignment-equals-approval model
PR merge policy and the error-resolution clause
Coding agent rules of engagement
Non-negotiable code and data invariants
Security posture
Advisory-AI boundary
Escalation discipline
Version control and audit obligations
This document is the top of the source-of-truth hierarchy for engineering and operational decisions in any repo it lands in. Where any other repo file conflicts with this document, this document prevails until amended.

This document is itself governed: see §11 for amendment procedure.

1. CEO ASSIGNMENT-EQUALS-APPROVAL

When the CEO assigns a task to a coding agent (Claude Code, Copilot, Claude in chat, or any other authorized agent), that assignment IS the approval to proceed. The agent does NOT pause to request CEO confirmation before executing.

The agent proceeds autonomously until one of the following occurs:

The task is complete and ready for PR.
The agent encounters a block it cannot resolve (see §3 escalation triggers).
The agent identifies that completing the task would violate an invariant in §5 or §6.
In cases 2 and 3, the agent escalates with a single, clear question. The agent does NOT escalate to confirm decisions the CEO has already implicitly approved by assigning the task.

Never ask "should I do the thing you just told me to do."

2. PR MERGE POLICY

2.1 Default — Auto-merge

PRs auto-merge on green CI. No human review required by default. Agents land their work on main autonomously when:

All CI checks pass
No merge conflicts exist
No unresolved errors are present on the branch (see §2.3)
The PR does not touch a Human-Review Category (see §2.2)
2.2 Human-Review Categories (CEO merge required)

The following narrow categories require CEO PR merge regardless of CI state. These are the only exceptions to auto-merge.

Changes to OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md itself (this document)
Schema migrations touching financial invariants — any migration that adds, alters, or drops a column named or aliased as balance, tokens, payout, escrow, commission, wallet, ledger_entry, or any column carrying money-like semantics
New compliance constants — additions or modifications to compliance-governing values (dispute thresholds, age-gate parameters, retention windows, jurisdictional rule references, regulatory bill identifiers)
Anything not in this list auto-merges. The list is intentionally narrow. Expansion of this list requires a §11 amendment.

2.3 Error-Resolution Clause

If a PR is mergeable (no conflicts, gates passed) but the branch carries unresolved errors of any kind — failing tests, lint failures, type errors, build warnings escalated to errors, broken CI steps that were skipped, dependency warnings, deprecation notices, or any other diagnostic flagged by tooling — the merge does NOT auto-land.

The agent that opened the PR (Copilot, Claude Code, or other) MUST first attempt to resolve the errors autonomously. CEO intervention is the last resort, not the first.

The agent escalates to CEO only when ALL of the following are true:

The error is outside the agent's resolution capability (e.g., requires a credential the agent cannot access, requires a product or policy decision, requires external service action), OR
The agent has attempted resolution and the fix would exceed the original PR's scope (broad refactor required, breaking change required), OR
The agent has attempted resolution at least twice and the error persists.
In any escalation case, the agent posts a single comment on the PR stating, in this order:

What the error is (exact diagnostic)
What the agent attempted (each attempt, briefly)
Why escalation is required (which of the three conditions above applies)
What specific decision or action is needed from CEO
Mergeable + clean = auto-merge. Mergeable + dirty = agent fixes first, escalates only on block.

2.4 Reverts

If an auto-merged PR is later found to have introduced a defect, any agent may open a revert PR. Revert PRs follow the same auto-merge policy. They are not Human-Review Category by default unless they touch §2.2.

3. ESCALATION DISCIPLINE

3.1 When to escalate

Escalate to CEO only when one of the following occurs:

§2.3 conditions are met on a PR
A task assignment requires interpretation of intent the agent cannot resolve from context (e.g., two valid implementations exist with materially different consequences)
Executing the task would violate §5, §6, or §7 invariants
A required external resource is unavailable (vendor outage, missing credential, broken integration)
Discovery during the task reveals the task description was based on incorrect assumptions about the repo state
3.2 When NOT to escalate

Do not escalate to CEO for:

Confirmation of an already-assigned task ("just to double-check, you want me to...")
Style choices within an established convention
Naming decisions covered by an existing glossary or naming authority file in the repo
Decisions where the agent has sufficient context to choose responsibly
Status updates during long-running work (use commit messages or PR descriptions instead)
3.3 Escalation format

One question. Concrete. Resolvable in one CEO reply. State:

What you were doing
What you encountered
What specific decision you need
What you will do once the decision is made
If a single question would generate more than three follow-up questions, restructure the work and escalate later when the right question is clear.

4. CODING AGENT RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

4.1 Agents covered

Any AI agent operating against an OmniQuest Media Inc. repository, including but not limited to:

Claude Code (CLI, IDE, GitHub Action)
GitHub Copilot (chat, agent mode, PR mode)
Claude in chat (anthropic.claude.com or API)
Any future agent introduced into the workflow
4.2 Mode of operation

Agents operate in Droid Mode by default: execute the assigned task as written, no creative deviation. If the task description appears to require creative deviation to be executable, that is an escalation per §3.1.

4.3 Prohibited behaviors

Agents must not:

Refactor code outside the scope of the assigned task without explicit instruction
Modify another agent's completed and merged work without explicit instruction
Fabricate command output, test results, or file contents in any report
Skip required tests or CI gates to land work
Bypass §2.3 error-resolution by force-merging
Mark a task complete when known errors remain unresolved
Introduce new dependencies or replace package managers without explicit instruction (see §5.3)
4.4 Required behaviors

Agents must:

Read the repo's existing OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md (this document) before any non-trivial action
Read the repo's OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md (if present) to understand current backlog state before starting new work
Read any repo-resident naming authority file (e.g., docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md) before introducing new identifiers
Leave a ## HANDOFF block at the bottom of any file or branch left in an incomplete state, stating: what was built, what was intentionally left incomplete, and the next agent's first task
Use the repo's specified package manager (see §5.3)
Respect commit discipline (see §8)
5. NON-NEGOTIABLE CODE INVARIANTS

These apply to every OmniQuest Media Inc. repo unless explicitly overridden in writing in a repo-resident OQMI_GOVERNANCE_OVERRIDES.md file approved by CEO.

5.1 Append-only, deterministic, idempotent

These three properties apply to all financial, audit, and compliance-touching code:

Append-only: No UPDATE or DELETE on ledger, audit, balance, payout, or session-record tables. Corrections are offset entries, never modifications.
Deterministic: Given the same inputs, the system must produce the same outputs. No silent randomness in financial or compliance logic. Use crypto.randomInt() only for game outcomes, never for financial calculations.
Idempotent: Repeated execution of the same operation must produce the same end state. All money-like operations require an idempotency key.
5.2 Schema discipline

Every table touching financial, compliance, or audit data must include correlation_id and reason_code columns
No hardcoded financial constants; all such constants live in a single config file (e.g., governance.config.ts) and are version-controlled
Schema migrations touching §2.2 columns are Human-Review Category
5.3 Package management

Each repo declares its package manager in its root README.md. Default for OmniQuest Media Inc. repos is Yarn. Do not introduce npm or pnpm unless the repo's README explicitly authorizes it. Do not mix package managers in a single repo.

5.4 Domain separation

UI logic, game logic, and feature logic must never be mixed with financial, authentication, or ledger logic. Prefer small, composable services with clean interfaces.

5.5 No backdoors

No master passwords, magic strings, undocumented overrides, debug bypasses, or hidden admin paths. If an emergency override is required, it must be documented, role-bound, logged, and require step-up authentication (see §6.4).

6. SECURITY POSTURE

6.1 Secrets

Never log, expose, commit, or transmit:

API keys, tokens, credentials
Passwords or password hashes
Personally identifiable information (PII)
Payment data (card numbers, CVV, bank account details)
Identity verification documents
6.2 Network isolation

Database and cache services (Postgres, Redis, equivalents) must never be bound to a public interface. Any violation is an INFRA_SECURITY_VIOLATION and is a Human-Review Category escalation.

6.3 Least privilege

All access controls follow least-privilege. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is enumerated explicitly per repo. No implicit role inheritance beyond declared scope.

6.4 Step-up authentication

Required for sensitive operations:

Wallet or balance modification
Payment detail changes
Account suspension or freeze
Content takedown or deletion
Refund override
Geo-block modification
Any break-glass action
Accepted mechanisms: TOTP (RFC 6238), single-use hashed backup codes, device-based authentication. SMS is not the primary method.

6.5 Audit logging

All sensitive actions emit an audit event with, at minimum:

event_id, event_type, actor_id, role
timestamp_utc and platform_time (America/Toronto)
rule_applied_id, device_fingerprint (where applicable)
hash_prev, hash_current for chain integrity
payload_reference (hash, not raw payload, for sensitive payloads)
7. ADVISORY-AI BOUNDARY

AI systems operating against or within OmniQuest Media Inc. repos and platforms are advisory-only. AI may:

Summarize data
Draft communications
Propose escalation pathways
Interpret documented policy
Generate, modify, or review code under §1 assignment authority
AI may NOT:

Compute earnings, commissions, payouts, or wallet states (these are deterministic services)
Mutate ledger state directly
Authorize refunds
Suppress content
Suspend accounts
Override enforcement
Alter verification status
Approve its own PRs to Human-Review Categories (§2.2)
All irreversible user-facing actions require a human authorization within RBAC boundaries. AI proposals for irreversible actions must include a snapshot timestamp, a confidence qualifier, and a "human review required" boundary reminder when surfaced to operators.

8. COMMIT DISCIPLINE

Every commit must be:

Atomic — one logical change per commit
Descriptive — commit message states what changed and why in plain language
Scoped — prefixed with the repo's declared service scope or commit prefix convention (declared in repo root README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md)
Commits touching financial-integrity paths require this four-line format:

<SCOPE>: <short description>
REASON: <why this change is necessary>
IMPACT: <what balances or flows are affected>
CORRELATION_ID: <uuid>
The financial-integrity path list is repo-specific and declared in the repo's OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md or equivalent state file. Default OmniQuest Media Inc. financial paths are: finance/**, any services/*/ledger*, governance/**, and any schema migration touching §2.2 columns.

9. AGENT HANDOFF PROTOCOL

When work is handed between agents (within the same repo or across repos):

The handing agent leaves a ## HANDOFF block at the bottom of the relevant file, or in a HANDOFF.md in the affected service folder, or as a final commit message in the relevant branch.
The block must state: what was built, what was intentionally left incomplete, and what the next agent's first task is.
No agent modifies another agent's completed work without an explicit instruction from the CEO.
Cross-thread handoffs (chat-to-chat) follow the same discipline: a Thread N→Thread N+1 handoff document, embedding any standing rules verbatim, lives in the repo's PROGRAM_CONTROL/HANDOFFS/ directory or equivalent.
10. CONFLICT RESOLUTION HIERARCHY

When repo files appear to conflict, this is the order of precedence:

OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md (this document)
The repo's product/platform Canonical Corpus (if one exists, e.g., ChatNow.Zone Canonical Corpus for the CNZ repo)
The repo's OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md
The repo's docs/DOMAIN_GLOSSARY.md (naming authority)
The repo's README.md
Per-service README.md or HANDOFF.md files
Inline code comments
Where a higher-precedence document is silent, the next document down applies. Where a higher-precedence document is explicit, lower-precedence documents that disagree are stale and must be amended.

11. AMENDMENT PROCEDURE

Amendments to this document follow the Human-Review Category procedure (§2.2). To amend:

Open a PR modifying OQMI_GOVERNANCE.md in the affected repo
PR description states: section being amended, current language, proposed language, rationale
CEO reviews and merges
Once merged, the amended document is propagated to all other OmniQuest Media Inc. repos by either: (a) a copy-forward PR opened in each repo by an agent, or (b) a CEO-driven manual sync
Document version is incremented on every amendment. Version bump rules:

Patch (v1.0 → v1.0.1): Wording clarification, no semantic change
Minor (v1.0 → v1.1): New rule added, no existing rule changed
Major (v1.0 → v2.0): Existing rule changed, removed, or invariant rebalanced
12. INVARIANTS REGISTER (QUICK REFERENCE)

Standing invariants every agent must know without lookup:

CEO assignment IS approval; agents proceed unless blocked
PRs auto-merge on green CI except §2.2 Human-Review Categories
Mergeable + dirty = agent fixes first, escalates only on block (§2.3)
No UPDATE or DELETE on ledger, audit, balance, payout, or session-record tables
All money-like operations require an idempotency key
Every financial/audit table includes correlation_id and reason_code
Postgres and Redis never on public interfaces
No hardcoded financial constants; all from declared config file
Yarn for OmniQuest Media Inc. repos unless README explicitly says otherwise
AI is advisory; humans authorize irreversible actions
Never log secrets, tokens, credentials, PII, or payment data
Never fabricate command output, test results, or file contents
Read this document and OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md before non-trivial actions
Leave a ## HANDOFF block on any incomplete work
Commit discipline: atomic, descriptive, scoped; FIZ four-line format on financial-integrity paths
No Jaime Watt / Navigator Ltd. references in any OmniQuest Media Inc. material
13. END OF DOCUMENT

This document is the standing governance instrument for OmniQuest Media Inc. repositories. It is repo-portable and drops into any repo unchanged. Repo-specific extensions live in OQMI_GOVERNANCE_OVERRIDES.md (only with CEO approval) or in the repo's OQMI_SYSTEM_STATE.md.
