## What Are Reference Branches?

All branches prefixed with `refs/` are **PERMANENT READ-ONLY REFERENCE LIBRARIES**.
They contain cloned open-source repositories, research materials, or internal reference
content used by Claude Code and Copilot when authoring directives.
They are never deleted and never merged to main.

---

## Absolute Rules

- `refs/*` branches **NEVER** merge to main under any circumstances
- `refs/*` branches are never deleted
- `refs/*` content is never imported into RRR source files
- No `package.json`, `tsconfig`, or build config may reference `refs/*` content

---

## How Agents Read Reference Branch Files

```
git show refs/{category}/{branch-name}:{filepath}
```

**Examples:**
```
git show refs/oss/booking-api:prisma/schema.prisma
git show refs/oss/socketio-chat:app.js
git show refs/internal/design-system:tokens.json
```

---

## How to Reference in Directives

Add to the `CONTEXT` section of any directive:
```
REFERENCE: git show refs/{category}/{name}:{filepath}
```

---

## CI Enforcement

`.github/workflows/protect-ref-branches.yml` blocks any PR from a `refs/*` branch
targeting `main` automatically.
