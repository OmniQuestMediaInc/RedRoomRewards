# RedRoom Rewards — Assumptions

## RRR-TIERS-GIFTING (Payload #2)

- Tier thresholds and vibes are hardcoded per CEO specification
- Creator gifting uses existing LedgerService (`createGiftingPromotion` stub assumed)
- GateGuard AV is enforced at redemption time (not creation)
- Payload #1 interfaces (`RedRoomTier`, `GateGuardAVResult`, `AwardingWalletUploadRow`, `AwardingWalletUploadResult`) were not previously committed on this branch (`claude/review-coding-protocols-jxp71-A7M0p`); they were seeded into `src/interfaces/redroom-rewards.ts` from the sibling branch `claude/review-coding-protocols-jxp71` so the new `TierProgress`/`CreatorGiftingPromotion` appends resolve. See F-006.

## RRR-WGS-LEDGER (Payload #3)

- WGS scoring is stubbed (full WO-006 model coming in next payload)
- All RedRoom Rewards points flow through RedRoomLedgerService (Promotional Bonus bucket)
- High-value awards (>1000 points) trigger WGS check

## RRR-API-MEMBER-MERCHANT (Payload #4)

- AwardingWalletService integrates with existing LedgerService (awardPromotionalPoints method added via small patch in Payload #1)
- CSV parsing and validation assumed to be handled in controller or a future middleware layer
- All points awarded go into the Promotional Bonus bucket per Canonical Corpus
- Member signup now enforces mandatory GateGuard AV as brand standard
- All points awarded via `RedRoomLedgerService` (Promotional Bonus bucket)
- Merchant endpoints use existing auth context from `req.user`
- `TierEngineService` is the Payload #2 implementation (no changes in this payload)
- `RedRoomLedgerService` is the Payload #3 implementation (no changes in this payload) — MemberService invokes `awardPointsWithCompliance(memberId, 1000, 'WELCOME_BONUS')`

## RRR-BURN-REPORTING (Payload #5)

- Burn catalog integrates with RedRoomPleasures as the first redemption partner
- Reporting service provides AirMiles-level liability statements
- All burns route through RedRoomLedgerService for compliance

## RRR-WHITELABEL-CREATOR-FINAL (Payload #6)

- White-label SAAS supports both hosted (service-bureau) and self-hosted modes
- Creator gifting panel returns current balance + recent promotions for ChatNow.Zone embed
- All new controllers follow existing auth pattern via req.user

## RRR-FINAL-WIRING (Payload #7)

- All modules are now properly wired in AppModule
- Full NestJS architecture is in place and matches the repo
- All services follow existing ledger and auth patterns
- `LedgerService` (in `src/ledger/ledger.service.ts`) is not decorated with `@Injectable()` and its constructor takes a `Partial<LedgerConfig>` config object. To allow NestJS DI to instantiate it without resolving a non-existent type token, each module that depends on it (Member/Merchant/Burn/RedRoomLedger) registers it via `{ provide: LedgerService, useFactory: () => new LedgerService() }`. See F-016.
- `WelfareGuardianScoreService` is added to `MemberModule` and `BurnModule` providers because it is a transitive dependency of `RedRoomLedgerService`. Payload #7 listed it only under `RedRoomLedgerModule`, but Nest resolves providers per-module.

## RRR-ENGINE-COMPLETE (Payload #10)

- All 10 payloads are now integrated and wired
- Production config (`src/config/production.config.ts`) is in place and loaded globally via `ConfigModule.forRoot({ load: [productionConfig] })`
- `.env.example` extended with `GATEGUARD_AV_API_KEY`, `GATEGUARD_AV_ENDPOINT`, and `SERVICE_BUREAU_ENABLED` (existing security-critical secrets preserved, not replaced)
- `HealthController` exposes `GET /api/v1/health` returning service status, timestamp, and uptime
- `@nestjs/config@^4.0.0` installed as a runtime dependency
- Engine is ready for staging deployment

## RRR-DEPLOYMENT-READY (Payload #11)

- Final payload completes all external user components
- Engine is fully wired and ready for staging deployment
- `src/config/app.config.ts` added and loaded alongside `productionConfig` in `AppModule`
- `DEPLOYMENT-CHECKLIST.md` captures pre-deploy verification, staging steps, and production go-live tasks
- `.env.example` was extended (not replaced) with the Payload #11 `DATABASE_URL` alias; existing security-critical entries (`JWT_SECRET`, `QUEUE_AUTH_SECRET`, `RRR_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `MONGODB_URI`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, etc.) are preserved per F-021 precedent
- `/health` is already exposed outside the `api/v1` global prefix (see #283) and continues to return 200
- OpenAPI docs are already served at `/api/docs` (see #279)

## RRR-WAVE-B-CORE (Payload #12)

- B-001 (`creditPoints` wiring), B-002 (`deductPoints` wiring), and B-006 (MongoDB transaction safety) are now implemented end-to-end
- New `WalletController` at `src/controllers/wallet.controller.ts` exposes `POST /wallet/credit` and `POST /wallet/deduct` and forwards directly into `LedgerService.creditPoints` / `LedgerService.deductPoints`
- `WalletModule` (`src/wallets/wallet.module.ts`) is registered in `AppModule`; `LedgerService` is provided via `useFactory` per F-017 to avoid the `Partial<LedgerConfig>` DI token issue
- `LedgerService.creditPoints` and `LedgerService.deductPoints` accept an optional Mongoose `ClientSession` (the 6th arg) so callers can enlist these writes in an outer transaction. When no session is supplied, the service opens its own via the new private `withTransactionSafety` wrapper
- `LedgerService.createEntry` accepts an optional `ClientSession` second argument and threads it into `LedgerEntryModel.create([doc], { session })` when provided, so the immutable ledger write participates in the outer transaction
- `withTransactionSafety` only attempts a transaction when `mongoose.connection.readyState === 1` and falls back to non-transactional execution if the topology rejects transactions (standalone, retryable-writes errors). This keeps unit tests deterministic without a replica set; production must run a replica set for the real transactional path to fire (F-029)
- Existing balance-validation semantics on `creditPoints` / `deductPoints` (positive-amount check, insufficient-balance rejection, Promotional Bonus bucket via `PROMOTIONAL_AWARD` / `ADMIN_DEBIT` reason codes) are preserved — these were already in place from prior payloads
- `RedRoomLedgerService.awardPointsWithCompliance` is unchanged; it already uses `LedgerService.creditPoints` and now inherits transaction safety transparently (F-032)

## RRR-WAVE-B-CONTINUATION (Payload #14)

- B-007 `MerchantPairConfig` model was already present (committed prior to this payload) with a more comprehensive implementation using snake_case field names (`tenant_id`, `from_merchant_id`, `to_merchant_id`, `exchange_rate`, `effective_at`, `superseded_at`) and effective-dating via a unique partial index on the active row. The payload-proposed simpler camelCase schema was not applied.
- B-008 No-hardcoded-balance CI guard was already present as `scripts/ci/no-hardcoded-balance.js` (singular) with a more comprehensive implementation including self-test mode, allow-comment exemption, and schema-index exemption. The payload-proposed simpler version was not applied.
- B-009 Tenant-id scope CI guard was already present as `scripts/ci/tenant-id-scope-check.js` with `scripts/ci/tenant-id-allowlist.json`. The charter B-009 description ("CI guard") matches this implementation. The payload described B-009 as "Tenant-scope middleware" (a different concept); see F-033.
- `CrossMerchantExchangeService` added at `src/services/cross-merchant-exchange.service.ts` — resolves the active exchange rate from `MerchantPairConfig` using correct snake_case fields and `superseded_at: null` for active-row selection; falls back to `getDefaultExchangeRate()` (1.0) per CEO Decision B4. This is a Wave C item (chartered under Wave C provisional list) delivered early at CEO direction.
- `TenantScopeMiddleware` added at `src/middleware/tenant-scope.middleware.ts` — NestJS `NestMiddleware` that propagates `req.tenantId` into `req.queryOptions.tenant_id` for downstream service use. This is new infrastructure not explicitly chartered in Wave B; registered here per payload authority (see F-033).

## Wave B Continuation — Payload #15 (B-010, B-011, B-012)

- B-010: `IdempotencyService` was already fully implemented with production-quality
  MongoDB-backed storage, canonical `IDEMPOTENCY_OPERATIONS` constants covering all
  FIZ mutation operations (wallet_credit, wallet_deduct, point_redemption,
  point_expiration, escrow_hold/release/settle/refund), and a comprehensive
  `idempotency.service.spec.ts` test suite. The payload stub was not installed to
  avoid downgrading the existing implementation.

- B-011: `ReconciliationService` added to `src/services/reconciliation.service.ts`.
  Wraps `LedgerService.generateReconciliationReport` for full-history reconciliation
  of user and model accounts. Emits `RECON_MISMATCH` log on discrepancy; never
  auto-corrects balances (append-only invariant preserved).

- B-012: `LedgerService` invariant tests were already complete at
  `src/ledger/ledger.service.invariants.spec.ts` with four invariants: append-only
  reflection, monotonic sequence, balance projection, and non-null
  `correlation_id` + `reason_code`. The payload's simpler duplicate spec was not
  installed; the existing comprehensive test satisfies the charter requirement.
## Wave B Final Cleanup (Payload #16 — B-013 through B-CLEAN)

- B-013 admin-ops tests added — 26 tests, full coverage of all public methods in `src/services/admin-ops.service.ts` (manualAdjustment, processRefund, correctBalance, getAdminOperationHistory)
- B-014 any-type fix completed — `const query: any = {}` in `src/ingest-worker/replay.ts` replaced with an explicit `{ eventId?: string; eventType?: string; movedToDLQAt?: {...} }` typed object
- B-015 type modules split — `src/wallets/types.ts` split into `src/wallets/types/{domain.types,escrow.types,queue.types,index}.ts`; `src/services/types.ts` split into `src/services/types/{queue.types,service.types,error.types,index}.ts`; all existing import paths `from '../wallets/types'` and `from '../services/types'` continue to resolve to the new `index.ts` barrel files with no shape changes
- B-016 unknown narrowing applied — replaced all `any` casts in `src/ledger/ledger.service.ts` (query objects, mapToDomain casts, sort object) with typed inline interfaces or explicit enum casts; updated `storeIdempotencyResult` in `src/ledger/types.ts` from `result: any` to `result: unknown`; updated `WalletServiceError.details` and `IdempotencyConflictError` constructor in `src/services/types/error.types.ts` from `any` to `unknown`
- Wave B now complete — 41 test suites, 429 tests all pass; pre-existing build error in `src/api/receipt-endpoint.example.ts:144` (Type narrowing on union) is unrelated to these changes

## Wave C Continuation — Payload #20 (C-009, C-010, C-011)

- C-009 `CrossMerchantExchangeService`: Payload #20 proposed a stub using the `MerchantPairConfig`
  model with camelCase field names. A production-quality implementation already exists at
  `src/services/cross-merchant-exchange.service.ts` (correct snake_case fields, `.lean()`,
  `superseded_at: null` active-row filter, CEO Decision B4 1:1 default). The existing service and
  its comprehensive spec at `src/services/cross-merchant-exchange.service.spec.ts` fully satisfy
  the C-009 charter task. The payload stub was not installed.

- C-010 `TierEvaluationService`: Payload #20 cannot be installed as specified — three blocking
  model conflicts exist: (1) `LoyaltyAccount` has no `lifetime_points` (or `lifetimePoints`) field;
  (2) `rrr_member_tier` is typed as `RrrMemberTier` (`PLATINUM | GOLD | SILVER | MEMBER | GUEST`),
  incompatible with the `RED_*` tier values used in the payload; (3) `WebhookEmitService` does not
  exist in the repository. Per coding doctrine §9.4, these gaps require a spec change before
  implementation. See FLAG F-042.

- C-011 `SettlementService`: Payload #20 proposed a stub that creates a `SettlementRecord`.
  A proper `SettlementRecord` model was added at `src/db/models/settlement-record.model.ts`
  and the service installed at `src/services/settlement.service.ts`. `total_redeemed` aggregation
  is stubbed at 0 pending the B-011 reconciliation job wiring. Unit tests added.

## Wave C Continuation — Payload #18 (C-003, C-005, C-006)

- C-003 `PointExpirationService` + `SpendOrderConfig` wiring: Payload #18 proposed a stub replacement
  (`console.log` only). The existing `src/services/point-expiration.service.ts` is a complete
  production implementation with ledger integration, optimistic-locking wallet debit, idempotency
  keys, and batch processing. The stub was not installed to avoid downgrading the implementation.
  `src/services/__tests__/point-expiration.service.comprehensive.spec.ts` covers the existing service.

- C-005 `TenantScopeMiddleware`: Payload #18 proposed a stub using untyped `any` parameters.
  `src/middleware/tenant-scope.middleware.ts` already has a properly-typed implementation
  (`Request & { tenantId?: string; queryOptions?: Record<string, unknown> }`, `Response`,
  `NextFunction`). The stub was not installed. Registration in `AppModule.configure()` is still
  deferred until the auth guard that populates `req.tenantId` is in place (see F-034).

- C-006 `ReconcileController` (remove feature flag, use auth middleware): Payload #18 proposed
  a `@Post('admin/reconcile')` endpoint with no auth guard and no entry in `api/openapi.yaml`.
  Coding doctrine §9.2 requires all endpoints to have authentication per the OpenAPI spec;
  §9.4 prohibits creating endpoints not described in the spec. The file was not installed.
  The endpoint must be specced in `api/openapi.yaml` with appropriate auth before implementation.

## Wave C — Payload #19 (C-007 + C-008)

- C-007 webhook receive infrastructure added: `src/webhooks/webhook-receive.controller.ts`,
  `src/webhooks/webhook-receive.service.ts`. `POST /webhooks/receive` accepts inbound events,
  verifies HMAC-SHA256 signature (stub returns true when `RRR_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset),
  and deduplicates via `IdempotencyService` using operation `'webhook_receive'` and tenant
  scope `'system'`. Real ingest-worker queue wiring is deferred to a future payload.
- C-008 webhook emit service stubbed: `src/webhooks/webhook-emit.service.ts` logs and returns
  true. Full outbound POST + HMAC + retry logic deferred to the next payload.
- `WebhookModule` registered in `AppModule`. `IdempotencyService` provided via `useFactory`
  (no `@Injectable()` on the class) per the existing F-017 factory pattern.
## Wave C Start (Payload #17 — C-001, C-002, C-004)

- C-001: `calculateEarnRate` added to `PointAccrualService` — queries active `EarnRateConfigModel` row for the given tenant/merchant/tier/event combination; applies `base_points_per_unit * inferno_multiplier * amount`; honours CEO Decision D3 (Diamond Concierge zero-earn). Existing `awardPoints`/`deductFromAvailable` methods are unchanged.
- C-002: `validateTierCap` added to `PointRedemptionService` — queries active `TierCapConfigModel` row; validates that `redemptionAmount ≤ (redemption_cap_pct / 100) * transactionValue`; no platform defaults per CEO Decision B5. Existing `redeemPoints` escrow flow is unchanged.
- C-004: `AuthMiddleware` added at `src/middleware/auth.middleware.ts` — NestJS `NestMiddleware`; extracts Bearer JWT via `jsonwebtoken`; populates `req.tenantId` and `req.userId`; leaves unauthenticated requests for downstream guards to reject. Uses `JWT_SECRET` env var (same key as `AuthService`). Not yet registered in `AppModule.configure()` — see F-039.
