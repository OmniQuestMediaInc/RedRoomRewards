# RedRoom Rewards — Assumptions

## RRR-TIERS-GIFTING (Payload #2)

- Tier thresholds and vibes are hardcoded per CEO specification
- Creator gifting uses existing LedgerService (`createGiftingPromotion` stub assumed)
- GateGuard AV is enforced at redemption time (not creation)
- Payload #1 interfaces (`RedRoomTier`, `GateGuardAVResult`, `AwardingWalletUploadRow`, `AwardingWalletUploadResult`) were not previously committed on this branch (`claude/review-coding-protocols-jxp71-A7M0p`); they were seeded into `src/interfaces/redroom-rewards.ts` from the sibling branch `claude/review-coding-protocols-jxp71` so the new `TierProgress`/`CreatorGiftingPromotion` appends resolve. See F-006.

## RRR-WGS-LEDGER (Payload #3)

- WGS scoring is stubbed (full WO-006 model coming in next payload)
- All RedRoom Rewards points flow through RedRoomLedgerService (Promotional Bonus bucket)
- High-value awards (>1000 points) trigger WGS check

## RRR-API-MEMBER-MERCHANT (Payload #4)

- AwardingWalletService integrates with existing LedgerService (awardPromotionalPoints method added via small patch in Payload #1)
- CSV parsing and validation assumed to be handled in controller or a future middleware layer
- All points awarded go into the Promotional Bonus bucket per Canonical Corpus
- Member signup now enforces mandatory GateGuard AV as brand standard
- All points awarded via `RedRoomLedgerService` (Promotional Bonus bucket)
- Merchant endpoints use existing auth context from `req.user`
- `TierEngineService` is the Payload #2 implementation (no changes in this payload)
- `RedRoomLedgerService` is the Payload #3 implementation (no changes in this payload) — MemberService invokes `awardPointsWithCompliance(memberId, 1000, 'WELCOME_BONUS')`

## RRR-BURN-REPORTING (Payload #5)

- Burn catalog integrates with RedRoomPleasures as the first redemption partner
- Reporting service provides AirMiles-level liability statements
- All burns route through RedRoomLedgerService for compliance
