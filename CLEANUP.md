# CLEANUP CHECKLIST — RedRoomRewards

This document tracks all features, files, modules, and logic inherited from the chatnow.zone stack that MUST be removed or audited out of this repository.

**Goal:** Ensure RedRoomRewards is strictly limited to isolated, auditable, self-profile and points logic, with NO leftover social, media, or marketplace code.

## Mandatory Feature/Module Removal

All four legacy-concern sections below have been audited against `src/`
as of **2026-04-22 (RRR-WORK-001-A007)**. The audit grepped `src/` for
each concern's characteristic terms and found **no residual imports,
services, models, or code paths** matching any of them. Following
A-004 (deletion of the dead `api/src/modules/` NestJS tree), the only
executable code under `src/` is wallet / ledger / earn / redeem /
escrow / ingest / admin-ops / auth — all in-scope per the RRR charter.

Audit command (verbatim):
```
grep -rniE "<concern-terms>" src/ --include="*.ts"
  | grep -v "\.spec\.ts\|\.test\.ts\|test-setup\|__tests__"
```
with the concern-terms enumerated inline per section.
Matches returned were limited to unrelated state-machine labels
(`settling`, `refunding`), generic logger payload keys (`message`,
`errorMessage`), `PerformanceQueue` item references, and MongoDB
`connection` plumbing — none of which are legacy chatnow.zone code.

### 1. Media & Broadcasting
- [x] All video broadcasting modules, streaming services, upload handlers.
- [x] All image/picture/media uploading/download/display capabilities.
- [x] All media/asset storage and related endpoints.

Verified-clean terms: `broadcast`, `livestream`, `stream`, `upload`,
`media`, `image`, `video`, `cdn`, `avatar`, `thumbnail`.

### 2. Social/Interactive Features
- [x] "Goal" systems (collective progress, reward milestones, shared "goals").
- [x] Liking functionality (user likes, upvotes, hearts, etc.).
- [x] Spinning wheel / chance-based game logic. *(Also locked out
      by Invariant "Slot machine mechanics: permanently retired"
      — CEO Decision D1.)*
- [x] User-to-user or "model-to-user" messaging (including chat, DMs, inboxes, notifications, public or private rooms).
- [x] Any direct messaging, notification, or "shout" systems.

Verified-clean terms: `goal`, `like`, `spin`, `wheel`, `chat`,
`message`, `inbox`, `dm`, `notification`, `follow(er|ing)`.

### 3. Market/Commerce Logic
- [x] Product listing/posting UIs, APIs, DB models (including "offers," "items," or similar concepts).
- [x] Purchase, checkout, payment, or "sales" features as implemented for chatnow.zone.
- [x] Cart/wishlist, purchasing, or marketplace endpoints.
- [x] Any product-discovery, store, or model-monetization logic.

Verified-clean terms: `product`, `offer`, `item` (as in commerce —
only `PerformanceQueue` "queue item" remains, which is RRR-native),
`checkout`, `cart`, `wishlist`, `marketplace`, `storefront`, `catalog`.

### 4. Discovery/Social Browsing
- [x] User directory, search, or "profile browsing" features.
- [x] Any access to other user or "model" profiles (profile view endpoints, "people you may like," etc.).
- [x] Friends, following, or connection endpoints or UIs.
- [x] Any code path that reveals another user's existence except to admins.

Verified-clean terms: `directory`, `profile.?view`, `browse`,
`discover`, `friend`, `connection` (only MongoDB `connection`
plumbing remains), `following`.

## Other Areas for Audit

- [ ] Remove/disable all privileged, magic, or legacy admin backdoors.
  *(Follow-up: track under the SECURITY_AUDIT_AND_NO_BACKDOOR_POLICY
  review cadence; not in Wave A scope.)*
- [ ] Remove integrations with video CDNs or chat providers.
  *(Follow-up: no such integrations currently exist in `src/`; confirm
  again during Wave C webhook / external-integration work.)*
- [ ] Confirm logging/audit does not record or expose sensitive data.
  *(Follow-up: addressed in part by removal of `console.error` in
  `src/api/receipt-endpoint.example.ts` under A-008; broader PII-in-
  logs sweep is a Wave C item.)*
- [ ] Remove or rewrite legacy seeders, tests, or fixtures tied to old features.
  *(Follow-up: `archive/xxxchatnow-seed/` is already removed;
  re-verify no seeders reference retired concepts during Wave C.)*

## How to Use this List

Mark each item as complete when the module, API, endpoint, UI, or DB schema is purged. For ambiguous cases, escalate to architecture review.
